Text-Based-Reloading

A little script inspired by games such as Receiver and VR games like Pavlov and H3VR

Uses Python 3.7 because I love enum.auto()

Bit of a mess as of right now.

Commands need to be typed as word and followed by enter. Hotkeys in the future.

Default gun is a pump action shotgun.

Open bolt -> load (repeat untill full) -> close bolt -> fire -> open bolt -> close bolt -> fire (repeat untill empty)

When typo-ing or typing giberish returns a list of action that a weapon can do. Some weapons have diffirent actions than other weapons.

Things might still break.

Todo:

Replace the command words with hotkeys
